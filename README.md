Welcome to **car-marketplace-api**! This project serves as the back-end for a car marketplace website, built using **FastAPI**. It enables essential functionalities for managing users, car listings, and orders, streamlining the development of a car marketplace platform.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Technology Stack**:

- 🐍 **Python** 3.11 Version
- ⚡ **FastAPI** – Framework for building APIs
- 🗃️ **SQLAlchemy 2+** – ORM for handling database interactions
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – Database solution
- 📊 **Pydantic** – Data validation and schema management
- 🐳 **Docker** & **Docker Compose** – For containerization and easy deployment
- Pytest for tests

---

## 🛠️ Key Features and Endpoints

The API provides three main sets of endpoints:

1. **User** – Manage platform users, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user accounts.
2. **Car** – Manage car listings, including adding, viewing, editing, and removing car details.
3. **Order** – Process car purchase orders, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting orders.


Each endpoint supports the following methods:

- **GET** – Retrieve data (e.g., list cars or get user info)
- **POST** – Create new records (e.g., a new user or car listing)
- **PATCH** – Update records partially (e.g., edit user data or car details)
- **DELETE** – Remove records (e.g., delete a car listing)

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project follows several design patterns to ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code.

### Key Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Database operations are encapsulated in repositories located in the db/repositories folder, ensuring a clean separation of data access logic and core business logic.
- **Layered Architecture**: Code is divided into layers for routing (api), database handling (db), data validation (schemas), and configuration (config.py), which promotes modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's dependency injection allows injection of database sessions and repositories into route handlers, improving modularity and facilitating testing.
- **Configuration Management**: The config.py file centralizes environment variables, simplifying configuration across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose files allow consistent deployment across environments, making setup and scaling more reliable.
